            Hi, I'm Aviv Haruzi from Israel a full stack web developer üå†.
            <br>
            All the time I had a special connection to the computer if it's about video games and video editing or audio but it was a hobby no more than that.
            <br>
            While serving in the army I began to dig a little bit of development and technologies on the internet that a good friend suggested to me.
            <br>
            It was like discovering a new world I didn't know about even though it was in front of me all the time.
            <br>
            I decided to take it a step further and walk in an orderly fashion and learn a full stack course at John Bryce College in Tel Aviv.
            <br>
            During my studies, I discovered that this is the thing I want to engage in life and make the most out of it.
            <br>
            Now I'm currently focusing on the most advanced technologies especially MongoDB and node.js.
            <br>
            Front-end frameworks like angular and vue.js For cloud storage I'm focusing on amazon web services ‚òÅ and many more libraries and technologies that will be too long to list üòÑ you can check out my <router-link to="/skills">skills</router-link>.
